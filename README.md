## Summary

Enhance your Minecraft experience with the Revised Glass data pack, which provides a simple and user-friendly way to recolor your existing colored glass.

## How To Craft

Simply open a crafting table and place your chosen dye color in the center slot. Then, surround the dye with eight pieces of colored glass. The crafting table will transform these materials into your newly recolored glass, allowing you to customize your glass blocks and panes with the desired color.
